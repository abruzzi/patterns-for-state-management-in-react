## Title x

Since this is mostly about a pattern, I'd want the pattern name to be more prominent in the title

eg

"Headless Component: a pattern for composing React UIs"

"strategic" strikes me as a fuzzy adjective that's not really adding anything to the title. I also wonder whether "hooks" does much - would a reader be looking for articles about hooks? I'm in two minds about adding "react". The article is totally bound with react, and won't make much sense to people with little knowledge of react. However it may be that the pattern is applicable elsewhere, (see comment below).

## "Let's break down the component into smaller, manageable pieces" x

Now Headless Component is the main point of the article, it is important to indicate where the pattern is part of the discussion. This bit doesn't involve Headless Component, but is a useful lesson. So I would keep it in the article, but would include something like "this decomposition isn't part of the Headless Component pattern, but breaking a complex UI component into pieces is a valuable activity".

## "In this updated code structure, we've separated concerns" x

Somewhere around here I'd make the point that the component's logic at the moment is sufficiently simple that it's not worth applying Headless Component yet. It's only with the later enhancements, that introduce significant headless logic, that the pattern becomes worthwhile.

## "Moving forward, we can encapsulate the state and keyboard event handling logic " x

At this point I'd say we are applying Headless Component. We need to telegraph to the reader very clearly when the pattern comes into play.

## Effect on Testing x

As we get to "This division ensures that our component retains its core behavior", I'm beginning to wonder about something else that could be part of this article - is there an angle here about testing? One of the main reason I've always extracted non visual behavior is because in most UI platforms that makes it easier to test <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumbleObject.html>. I'm not familiar enough with react to know if that's true here - but is it now easier to write tests for useDropdown?

## "Incorporating fetching logic directly within our component can work, but it's not the most elegant or reusable approach" x

Again, I would highlight that this is applying Headless Component.

## Is this pattern just for React? x

Is this a pattern that's only applicable to React, or one that can be used in other UI platforms? It's quite reasonable to say "I don't know" - after all React is your main area of knowledge. Readers who are familiar with other UI platforms can decide for themselves whether this pattern makes sense elsewhere. But it's good to say that explicitly.
